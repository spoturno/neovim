# Neovim configuration
## Introduction
This is my personal Neovim configuration for all the platforms I use: Linux and Windows (also works for macOS). For simplicity, all the commands are Linux based, specifically Ubuntu distro (apt package manager). For example, if you are using Arch Linux in your case It will be `sudo pacman -S *package_name*`. For Windows users, my recommendation is to download the prerequisites from the official websites.
